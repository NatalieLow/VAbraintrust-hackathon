# VAHBrainTrust Hackathon

### Description
> Find a way to help other's who are either unaware (or rather not wanting to deal with) an observable problem. For this to work, we have to combat a number of things:
* Get close relatives or friends to speak for others who are in need
* Get a better language instead of the bureaucratic jargon in forms.
* Make it more personal and less systematic.
* Make this more universal as possible to be able to reach out and help many others.
* Make a person understand that this is, although not discrete, personal and will not be part of a system where a person in need is just a number.
